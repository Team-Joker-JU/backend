### üõ†Ô∏è Setup Workspace

Before running a development server, you'll need to setup the workspace with your own Cloudflare account by following these steps:

1. Create a local **wrangler.toml** file by copying the [`wrangler.example.toml`](.wrangler.example.toml) file and renaming it.

2. Login to Wrangler and authorize yourself by running the command:

```bash
wrangler login
```

3. Get your specific unique **Account ID** by running the command:

```bash
wrangler whoami
```

4. Insert the value of **Account ID** into the field **account_id** that exists in the newly created [`wrangler.toml`](.wrangler.toml) file.

**NOTE!**  
Make sure to not use the [`wrangler.prod.toml`](.wrangler.prod.toml) file to develop with, as this configuration file only will be used to publish the API.

### üíª Developing

For a local development server, run this command:

```bash
wrangler dev
```

You can also use the Cloudflare Worker preview server by running this command:

```bash
wrangler preview
```

### üì¶ Version Control

This project supports [commitizen/cz-cli](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli), which is a tool that generates commits that follows the standard [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

Add the files you want to commit by using `git add` and then run the commitizen command `cz`. Follow the steps and you will end up with a well formatted commit that you can push up to the repository via the command `git push`.

### üß™ Testing

This project comes with mocha tests which simply test that the request handler can handle each request method. `npm test` will run your tests.

### ‚úèÔ∏è Formatting

This project uses [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/) to format each files equally. To invoke, run `npm run format`.

### üòé Publish

```bash
wrangler publish
```
